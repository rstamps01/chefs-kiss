feat(categories): implement alphabetical sorting and fix deletion bug

## Summary
This commit implements comprehensive alphabetical sorting for all category
and unit lists throughout the application, and fixes a critical bug that
prevented category deletion in Settings.

## Changes Made

### Alphabetical Sorting (feat)
- Added automatic alphabetical sorting to recipe categories in Settings
- Added automatic alphabetical sorting to ingredient categories in Settings
- Added automatic alphabetical sorting to ingredient units in Settings
- Sorted recipe category dropdowns in List View filter
- Sorted recipe category dropdowns in Create Recipe modal
- Sorted recipe category dropdowns in Edit Recipe modal
- Sorted recipe category dropdown in table inline edit mode
- Sorting uses JavaScript's localeCompare() for consistent ordering
- Categories maintain alphabetical order when added, renamed, or toggled

### Category Deletion Bug Fix (fix)
- Fixed critical bug in deleteRecipeCategory function (server/db.ts)
- Corrected malformed SQL query that used invalid subquery syntax
- Replaced with proper two-step approach:
  1. Fetch category name from recipeCategories table
  2. Check if category is used in recipes/ingredients
- Both recipe and ingredient categories can now be deleted successfully
- Added proper error handling for category not found scenarios

### Category Separation (fix)
- Recipe Create/Edit modals now only show recipe categories
- Ingredient Create/Edit modals now only show ingredient categories
- Removed incorrect grouped dropdown logic that mixed category types

## Testing
- Verified alphabetical order in Settings for all category/unit lists
- Verified alphabetical order in all recipe category dropdowns
