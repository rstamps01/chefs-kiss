### 2.3. Clear Space & Minimum Size

To ensure the logo's integrity and legibility, always maintain a minimum clear space around it. The clear space should be at least the height of the 'C' in "Chef's Kiss".

The minimum size for the primary logo is 1 inch (2.54 cm) in width for print and 100 pixels in width for digital applications.

## 3. Color Palette

Our brand identity is built on a simple and elegant monochromatic color palette.

| Color | Hex | CMYK | RGB |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Black** | #000000 | 0, 0, 0, 100 | 0, 0, 0 |
| **White** | #FFFFFF | 0, 0, 0, 0 | 255, 255, 255 |

## 4. Typography

The Chef's Kiss wordmark uses a classic, elegant serif font in the style of **Didot** or **Bodoni**. For all other brand communications, we recommend using a clean and legible sans-serif font such as **Helvetica Neue** or **Lato**.

## 5. Logo Usage

- Use the **black logo** on light backgrounds.
- Use the **white logo** on dark backgrounds.
- Do not stretch, distort, or alter the logo.
- Do not change the logo's colors.
- Do not place the logo on busy backgrounds that compromise legibility.
- Do not add effects like shadows or glows.
